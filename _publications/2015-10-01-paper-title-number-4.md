excerpt: 'Graph fusion has emerged as a promising research area for addressing challenges associated with noisy, uncertain, multi-source data. While many ad-hoc graph fusion techniques exist in the current literature, an analytical approach for analyzing the fundamentals of the graph fusion problem is lacking. We consider the setting where we are given multiple Erdos-R ˝ enyi ´ modeled adjacency matrices containing a common hidden or planted clique. The objective is to combine them linearly so that the principal eigenvectors of the resulting matrix best reveal the vertices associated with the clique. We utilize recent results from random matrix theory to derive the optimal weighting coefficients and use these insights to develop a data-driven fusion algorithm'
