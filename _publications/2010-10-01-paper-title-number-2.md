excerpt: 'The Tucker Higher Order SVD is a popular algorithm for uncovering structure from tensor datacubes. This algorithm has been successfully used in many signal processing, machine learning and data mining applications. In this work, we use recent results from random matrix theory to analyze the performance of the HOSVD algorithm. In particular, we focus on the performance HOSVD on 3-D tensors for extraction of structure from signal-plus-noise tensors. We analyze the missing data setting where the entries of the signal-plus-noise tensor are randomly deleted'
