excerpt: 'The authors present a novel frequency division multiplexing scheme which can generate a
signal whose worst-case peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is tunable by an input parameter; they call this scheme tunable PAPR frequency division multiplexing (TP-FDM). Special cases of TP-FDM are orthogonal FDM (OFDM) and single carrier (SC) modulation.'
